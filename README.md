# SkipList
This program implements a doubly linked list structure that will hold integer nodes and execute a skip list strategy. The skip list is a probabilistic data structure that behaves as a sorted list and has a logarithmic running-time of O(log(n)) for inserting, locating and deletion of data inside the list. The general strategy of a skip uses subsequent layers of doubly linked lists built upon a base list. Additional nodes to the skip inserted at the base-level of the list and are then consulted by a random generator at insertion time. The random generator executes a “coin-toss” which gives each node a 50% chance of being inserted into the next upper level. Generally, nodes inserted into level i have a 50% chance of being inserted into level i+1. Each additional layers above the base layer contains fewer elements but no new node. Skip list’s maintain a linked hierarchy between the base layer’s individual nodes and each additional layer stacked on top of it to better assist in fast locating, insertion and deletion of nodes.
